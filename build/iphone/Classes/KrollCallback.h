// KrollCallback is a wrapper around a JS function object which is passed
// from JS land to native.  This object can be passed around on the native
// side as a normal opaque object and then passed back through to Kroll
// for function invocation (or just to pass the function object back as-is)
//
@interface KrollCallback : NSObject {
@private
	TiContextRef jsContext;
	TiObjectRef thisObj;
	TiObjectRef function;
	KrollContext *context;

// 
// KrollCallback has one fatal flaw: It can lead to retention loops. So when a
// function is to be a property of a proxy, we store this on the JS object. But
// if the proxy spans multiple contexts, we need to take a rain check on other
// contexts.

// In the mean time, for functions passed as a property between contexts, we
// need a lightweight wrapper. This is probably not the best way, but this
// should be sufficient for 1.7 in the edge case of one context needing to call
// another context's function.

// Until KrollObjectProperty and such are addressed in the future, this is an object that is never
// made explicitly by TiIdToValue; instead, all JS functions become KrollCallbacks, and both
// KrollCallbacks and KrollObjectProperties will be converted into functions (or TiObjectRefs at
// any rate)
